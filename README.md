# ratatoskr

In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr is a squirrel that lives on the world tree, Yggdrasil. He is known for running up and down the tree, carrying messages, often insults, between the eagle perched at the top of the tree and the serpent Níðhöggr who dwells beneath one of the tree's roots.

Please note that this is a personal project, for personal use, developed in my (not so much) free time. You'll not find clean code or a flexible, modular system here. You'll find lots of experiments, abandoned ideas, dead code, temporary hacks and workarounds. Oh, and last but not least, I'm just learning both Rust and RataTUI. You've been warned.

# Purpose
The aim of this project is to collect some metrics and write them to a single json file in a temporary directory. Every process can read this file, ensuring consistency and sync in data visualization between launcher and statusbar in my machine.

# TODO
- Add warning flag everywhere (ram, disk, temp, etc)
- Add network infos
- Add brightness infos
